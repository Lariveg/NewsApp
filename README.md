This is project is done for the Android Basics Nanodegree with Udacity. 

The goal is to create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:
- Connecting to an API
- Parsing the response of the API
- Handling error cases gracefully
- Updating information regularly
- Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle.

I put some screenshots with how the app looks in the screenshots directory.
